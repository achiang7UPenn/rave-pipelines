The data used in the figures comes from electrophysiological recordings (voltage traces) stored in HDF5 (.h5) files, where each file corresponds to a specific electrode.
The raw voltage data is extracted for specified blocks, electrode numbers, time windows (timestamp and duration in seconds), and sampling frequencies using Rave's built-in subject loading functions.

Additionally, the main.rmd file uses the RAVE framework to load subject-specific data, including:

Raw voltage traces from selected electrodes (e.g., electrode 14),
Trial-level condition labels (like auditory, visual, or audio-visual),
Epoch tables describing the timing and condition of each trial,
Sampling rate information

The processed data (used in figures) includes filtered power values over user-specified frequency ranges (e.g., 1â€“175 Hz), computed via the preprocess_data and preprocess_powers functions. Each condition or trial type is grouped and analyzed separately.
Thus, the figures are generated using a combination of raw iEEG voltage recordings and trial metadata from RAVE, which is then processed through both Python and R scripts to extract frequency features and statistical summaries (mean, standard deviation) for visualization.
As part of this process, we apply the FOOOF algorithm to decompose the power spectra into aperiodic and periodic components, enabling more precise feature extraction.
